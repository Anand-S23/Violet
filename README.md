# Violet

Violet is a simple static website generator written in C. Violet allows users
to write pages in mark down and will use a configuration file to build a website
how users would like. Though there will be an example site where
css will be included, you will need to write own css for the customization of the
website.

## Quick Start

After cloning the violet directory, the follow commands can be run depending on
your OS to get a quick start with violet. GCC complier must be installed on the
system for the build scripts to work.

**Linux:**
```
$ chmod +x ./build.sh
$ ./build.sh
$ ./bin/violet
```

## To Contribute

There are no major rules in terms of pull requests at the moments for requriements,
other than the changes must be on a seperate branch, where the name of the branch
clear outlines the feature that is being changed. I would also advise using the
same general code format that is currently being used.
